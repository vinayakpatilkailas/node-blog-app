Being a model or actor fascinated me from a young age, and I even did a couple of ads when I was just eight years old.Comedy is the most difficult. Comic timing is something which you either have it in you, or you don't. You have to have a good sense of humour to be able to understand it. A split second can make you lose the punch.Being a movie star isn't easy. It requires a lot of commitment and sacrifice. Your career goes through extreme ups and downs. You are judged all the time. Great things are written about you, but at the same time, not-so-good things are also said. At times, things are said about you that are completely untrue, and people mostly try to pull you down.At some level, I feel it is nice to know that a film of yours is doing well at the box office and has also got great reviews. That feels like successWhile I believe that when you are in the glamour industry, you have to look your best, I also believe being skinny is not 'hot and happening. To me, the mind and body are one. I'm very transparent, in a way, and people can very easily make out what mood I'm in. The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. Relationships or not, I believe that people don't need to know about my life beyond a certain point My parents never raised their hand or fired me. Their way of disciplining me was to tell me what is right or wrong. Maybe because I am from a sports background, I don't give up easily. I am a fighter I have always believed that chemistry can't be created between two people. You either have it or you don't. The script can only enhance itI have a lot of friends, but my biggest fear is loneliness. I miss my family in Mumbai, and my biggest nightmare every day is to go back home alone."

They are the most destructive, powerful, and irresistible weapons mentioned in Hinduism. These weapons are all created by Lord Brahma.It is termed as a fiery weapon that creates a fierce fireball,[1] blazing up with terrible flames and countless horrendous thunder flashes. When discharged, all nature including trees, oceans, and animals tremble, and the sky surrounds with flame, glaciers melt and mountains shatter with copious noise all around.When used, the Brahmastra which is person-centric can destroy a powerful enemy if he does not possess an alternate counter weapon. If it is Bhramashirsha Astra it causes collateral damage to every useful resource in a given area and prevents even a single blade of grass from ever growing in that area again. It is mentioned in Epic that there will be no rainfall for 12 Brahma years (12 Brahma years = 37.32 trillion human years) and climate conditions will worsen. The strike of the Brahmashira astra will eventually destroy everything.When Ashwatthama hurled the Brahmashira astra against Arjuna, the Pandava countered by invoking the same weapon; to prevent widespread destruction Narada and Vyasa stood between the two astras, ordering the two warriors to withdraw their weapons. (Arjuna, being the perfect practitioner of Brahmacharya, was able to do so; Ashwatthama could not call back his weapon because of his many flaws, and then compounded his sins by aiming the astra at Uttarā's womb to kill the unborn Parikshita.)"

    "description": "In a scene just before Amazon Prime’s Samaritan climaxes, the protagonist played by a worn and visibly old Sylvester Stallone tells an exuberant kid “The things is there is good and bad inside each one of us”. It is a rather declarative way of ending a film but given the film’s late narrative twist, it is also a neatly pulled-off message. But cinema isn’t just the messaging, but also the craft of leading you through a journey that makes the message palatable, even if unexpected. In Samaritan, no such thing happens as a film ripe with promise and casted perhaps to perfection, meanders pointlessly before turning around at the end, to reveal it had bright ideas all along, just not the tools to design a decent story around it. It is decent rescue act, loaded with an interesting moral quandary, but it appears in quantity far little, far too late.Samaritan is the story of the most obviously named white guy from Atlantic City – Joe Smith. Smith picks up garbage, wears a hoodie and keeps to himself. He is also an old man, an aspect of his character that the film does a poor job of exploring. Joe’s life is pre-dated by a famous feud between two superheroes –  the good one being Samaritan and the bad one called Nemesis. A fight to the end, we are told in the prologue, ended with the death of Nemesis. Samaritan has since gone missing too. Of course it has been clear all along, ever since the trailer for the film released that Stallone is the superhero out of commission. His withdrawal from playing saviour, however, isn’t exactly fleshed as much as it is argued over with the diction of someone who has just found what research is."

Sometimes, it is an eclipse, sometimes it is a meteor shower. But no matter what event, it is an occasion that you should not miss. Here, we have put together a list of celestial events that we can look forward to seeing in 2022.After the partial eclipse visible in certain parts of South America on April 30 this year, there is only one more solar eclipse left for us to witness: a partial one that will happen on October 25 and will be visible in Europe, Northeast Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, including India. The greatest part of the eclipse will be visible to viewers in India so save the date on your calendar.The total lunar eclipse that occurred on May 16 this year will not be the only one this year: another total lunar eclipse is predicted to happen once again on November 8 this year. However, just like the previous full lunar eclipse, it is unlikely that this one would be visible from India. But just like the one in May, the lunar eclipse in November will also presumably be live-streamed by multiple sources, allowing you to catch a glimpse."

Its sleek finish and unique engineering scream Apple design. Some critics complained that the iPad was just a big iPod Touch. And just as the company had changed the smartphone business with the release of the iPhone, Apple changed the tablet business. Or, rather, Apple created the tablet business: With the launch of the iPad, Apple created a market for touch-based devices designed for watching videos and browsing the web and reading digital books and e-mailBetween the debut of the iPad in early 2010 and the release of the fourth iPad revision in late 2012, Apple sold more than 100 million tablets [source: New York Times]. At $500 or more apiece, it's safe to say the iPad has been a tremendous success. And since the release of its original model, Apple has modified and improved the iPad with faster internals and a higher resolution screen to keep it ahead of the competition."

If you have never done one before, please make sure you practice with a certified teacher first.

Also, if one has back, shoulders, or lower body joint niggles, avoid doing the power clean. During movement, if there is any pain or discomfort, it is best to discontinue and do basic stretches."

On that account, it becomes necessary to understand whether yoga should be done on an empty stomach or notAnshuka Parwani, a yoga expert, and Pooja Makhija, a nutritionist took to Instagram to talk about this dilemma that many face.Pooja believes that it’s important to have something before starting with your exercise in the morning. It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.While both have contrasting opinions, they strongly agreed and upheld the point that you know your body better than anyone else. Hence, it’s important to observe and understand what your body is trying to tell you and do as one may deem fit. They said, if practising yoga on an empty stomach is suiting you better, do that.

Hypertension is essentially high blood pressure, and those who suffer from it may not exhibit any symptoms initially as it develops over the course of many years. This lack of symptoms makes it undetectable in time to prevent it or take remedial action, experts say.“Holistic practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, help handle stress in a productive and effective manner.

    "description": "Being physically active can help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A recent study in Diabetes Care found that women who get more steps have a lower risk of developing diabetes, compared to women who are more sedentary.1And a study in the journal Metabolites found that men who are more active have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to men who are more sedentary.2 It seems that physical activity significantly changes the body’s metabolite profile, and many of these changes are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, says Maria Lankinen, PhD, research scientist, Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland, and one of the researchers on the study published in Metabolites. Increased physical activity also improved insulin secretion.The study published in Diabetes Care focused on 4,838 older women (median age 78.9) without diabetes, who were followed for up to 6.9 years. Their steps were monitored by accelerometers to account for the number of steps and the intensity of steps, which were labeled as light-intensity or moderate- to vigorous-intensity.For diabetes among older adults, our findings indicate that moderate- to vigorous-intensity steps were more strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetes than light-intensity steps, adds John Bellettiere, PhD, an assistant professor of family medicine and public health at UC San Diego, and a co-author on the study."

The third, a control group, did at least 30 minutes of daily activity, but at a low intensity and didn't have heart rate measured.There was one major aspect of improvement that wasn't related to heart rate or cortical thickness, Dr. Haberg adds—it was whether the participants felt control over their choices. For example, those who were able to choose their activity, where they exercised, and whether they exercised alone or with a training buddy tended to have more beneficial outcomes.rforming an activity chosen by the individual is key to better brain health, says Haberg. Also, diligently following physical activity guidelines provides a significant cardiorespiratory effect in healthy older adults. That type of control also can be part of maintaining a regular fitness routine, previous research suggests, because it can lead to greater enjoyment with exercise. For example, one study notes that about 50% of participants in exercise programs drop out in the first 6 months, but that those who feel positive emotions tend to have significantly higher levels of program adherence"

This shows that food is one of the most important parts of our lives. One day we skip a meal, and our body starts reacting in a different way. While what we eat matters, another thing that plays a part is when we eat our meals. The time of having breakfast, lunch and dinner are vital to determine many health benefits. There is a common saying, “Early to bed, early to rise, makes us healthy, wealthy and wise.” Let’s turn it up a little and say, early dinner and early breakfast are all you need to be healthy and smart.Breakfast: Breakfast is the first meal of the day which makes our guts wake up. Usually, breakfast is eaten after 8 to 10 hours of having our dinner. The best time to have the first meal of the day is between 7 am to 9 am.Lunch: When you eat your breakfast early, it gives your stomach enough time to rest before you go on to your lunch. This aids digestion of breakfast. The best time to have lunch is between 12 noon to 2 pm. Dinner: As you have had your lunch early, you might feel hungry soon in the evening. Many dieticians recommend having early dinner in order to satisfy our hunger as well as boost metabolism. You should have your dinner between 6.30 pm to 8 pm.  If you have all your meals on a scheduled time daily, then it can help you boost your metabolism. In the morning, your metabolic rate works best, and as the day passes, it slows down. Therefore, having an early breakfast gives it a boost and an early dinner help it sustain."

    "description": "​​ How soon we renounce age-old traditions in the praxis of food, and succumb to the allure of convenience, short cuts, and finished good-looking products. I’m talking about age old dahi or curd. In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens."

    "description": "Every now and then, we stress upon the fact of eating lots of fruits and vegetables as they are packed with nutrients. They are said to be the best way to provide nutrition to the body and boost immunity. Every season comes with a variety of grains, vegetables, and fruits and we can’t agree more that they are tastier than the stored ones. However, do you know with time the nutrition value of fruits and vegetables are declining? Yes, you read that right. With time, due to various reasons that nutrition in fruits and vegetables have declined tremendously leaving us with various deficiencies. According to a National Geographic report, the experts find the root of the problem in the quality of soil. In the last few decades, the soil quality has been compromised due to various reasons including excessive chemical use, fertilisers, irrigation and so on. The harvesting methods have changed from natural ways to machineries which has also taken a dig at the health of the soil. Apart from it, due to global warming and climate change, the atmospheric temperature is rising and making the soil lose its moisture even more that do not hold the crops well putting them in risk of losing nutrition.The report also states that due to carbon dioxide increase in the air, the nutrient content of the fruits, vegetables and other crops are pulling down.David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington in Seattle emphasis on one of the major risks of the lower nutrient value, that is making our immunity low. According to him, “Nutrient decline is going to leave our bodies with fewer of the components they need to mount defences against chronic diseases — it’s going to undercut the value of food as preventive medicine,” state National Geographic."
